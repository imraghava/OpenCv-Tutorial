    "Welcome to another OpenCV tutorial. In this tutorial, we'll be covering thresholding for image and video analysis. The idea of thresholding is to further-simplify visual data for analysis. First, you may convert to gray-scale, but then you have to consider that grayscale still has at least 255 values. What thresholding can do, at the most basic level, is convert everything to white or black, based on a threshold value. Let's say we want the threshold to be 125 (out of 255), then everything that was 125 and under would be converted to 0, or black, and everything above 125 would be converted to 255, or white. If you convert to grayscale as you normally will, you will get white and black. If you do not convert to grayscale, you will get thresholded pictures, but there will be color.\n",

    "In the first section, I told you there is a second parameter retVal. Its use comes when we go for Otsu’s Binarization. So what is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "In global thresholding, we used an arbitrary value for threshold value, right? So, how can we know a value we selected is good or not? Answer is, trial and error method. But consider a bimodal image (In simple words, bimodal image is an image whose histogram has two peaks). For that image, we can approximately take a value in the middle of those peaks as threshold value, right ? That is what Otsu binarization does. So in simple words, it automatically calculates a threshold value from image histogram for a bimodal image. (For images which are not bimodal, binarization won’t be accurate.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, our cv2.threshold() function is used, but pass an extra flag, cv2.THRESH_OTSU. For threshold value, simply pass zero. Then the algorithm finds the optimal threshold value and returns you as the second output, retVal. If Otsu thresholding is not used, retVal is same as the threshold value you used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out below example. Input image is a noisy image. In first case, I applied global thresholding for a value of 127. In second case, I applied Otsu’s thresholding directly. In third case, I filtered image with a 5x5 gaussian kernel to remove the noise, then applied Otsu thresholding. See how noise filtering improves the result.\n",

    "In an image processing context, the histogram of an image normally refers to a histogram of the pixel intensity values. This histogram is a graph showing the number of pixels in an image at each different intensity value found in that image. For an 8-bit grayscale image there are 256 different possible intensities, and so the histogram will graphically display 256 numbers showing the distribution of pixels amongst those grayscale values. Histograms can also be taken of color images --- either individual histograms of red, green and blue channels can be taken, or a 3-D histogram can be produced, with the three axes representing the red, blue and green channels, and brightness at each point representing the pixel count. The exact output from the operation depends upon the implementation --- it may simply be a picture of the required histogram in a suitable image format, or it may be a data file of some sort representing the histogram statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Guidelines for Use\n",
    "\n",
    "Histograms have many uses. One of the more common is to decide what value of threshold to use when converting a grayscale image to a binary one by thresholding. If the image is suitable for thresholding then the histogram will be bi-modal --- i.e. the pixel intensities will be clustered around two well-separated values. A suitable threshold for separating these two groups will be found somewhere in between the two peaks in the histogram. If the distribution is not like this then it is unlikely that a good segmentation can be produced by thresholding."
